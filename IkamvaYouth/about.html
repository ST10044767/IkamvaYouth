                        SOUTH AFRICA’S EDUCATION SYSTEM IS IN CRISIS:
                        50% of children do not make it to Grade 12 (which is approximately half a million learners each year)
                        80% of South African schools are dysfunctional
                        We have the most unequal education system in the world: Of 200 black learners who start school, just one can expect to do well enough to study engineering. Ten white learners can expect the same result
                        In one study, maths teachers of 11- and 12-year-olds sat tests similar to those taken by their class. 79% of teachers scored below the level expected of the learners

IkamvaYouth was founded in 2003 by Joy Olivier and Makhosi Gogwana, who travelled very different paths to get to the same job, as researchers at the HSRC. Joy went to a privileged school in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, and Makhosi went to a township school in Khayelitsha, WC. In conducting research on the education crisis, they compared their experiences and realised that many of the obstacles learners face are due to lack of information and support. As information and support can be given free of charge, and the principal at Makhosi’s old school was receptive; Makhosi, Joy and their friends began volunteering as tutors and mentors, with a desire to support learners to reach their fullest potential.
IkamvaYouth provides a safe space for learners to be after class ends, where they receive help with their homework and a host of other services and support to ensure they succeed. Since our humble beginnings, we have grown from one branch to more than fifteen and support over 5,000 learners per year through our various programmes.

                          Our programme was co-created with learners and tutors. Our after-school sessions offer a range of services including academic tutoring, psycho-social support, career guidance, and lots more.
                          The core of our programme is tutoring. Volunteer tutors support learners in small groups to ensure that they understand their school work. Our army of superhero volunteers come from a range of backgrounds, but most are studying at university or college, and many of them are our alumni.
                          In Grade 12, we ensure learners apply to at least three post-school opportunities, so they enroll in tertiary institutions, learnerships or jobs the following year, so they have somewhere to go when they finish school. When these learners have their matric results, we then make sure that they are actually placed in a post-school opportunity.
                          We also provide computer literacy and e-learning classes and during our winter school we partner with organisations to offer: health, leadership and life skills workshops and media, image and expression workshops.
                          But, most of all IkamvaYouth is HOME to learners who often come from difficult environments, and when they enter the doors of IkamvaYouth they feel noticed and valued. At IkamvaYouth, learners are validated and celebrated for who they are. If you join our programme, you will find someone who will believe in you, hold you accountable and ensure you reach your fullest potential.
                          To join our programme there are no academic requirements for entry and participation is free of charge. However, in order to keep your place in the programme, you need to meet the attendance requirements.

                OUR VALUES
              </h2>
            </div>
            <p>       
               1. Collaboration and peer to peer support
               Contribute to the advancement of educational and social progress through team effort and offering
               the necessary support to enable a corresponding effect across all stakeholders, especially staff
               members, volunteers, and learners. School learners practically support their peers to achieve
               academic success, have high future aspirations, and support one another to realise their dreams.
               Ensure positive and responsive communication and share skills and knowledge that includes
               resources and information.
               <br></br>
               2. Commitment to impact
               Striving to make a positive difference in the lives of our learners, youth, community, and sector.
               Ensuring that our learners, partners and other beneficiaries obtain sustainable livelihoods and
               become progressive community change agents.
               <br></br>
               3. Continuous improvement
               Constantly seeking innovative ways of acquiring knowledge, improving skills, and developing positive
               attitudinal changes at individual, team and organisational level. This includes enhancing and
               streamlining the organisation’s model, processes and systems in order to remain current, relevant
               and on the cutting edge of our sector.
               <br></br>
               4. Inclusive governance
               Enabling and empowering ourselves, each other, and all stakeholders to use organisational policies,
               processes and systems to initiate governance conversations. Establishing ongoing consultation and
               negotiation with stakeholders so that they can take ownership and comply with decisions made by
               the governance structures.
               <br></br>
               5. Integrity and transparency
               Every team member commits to being honest and transparent in all interactions and transactions
               with IkamvaYouth stakeholders to foster trust and confidence.
               <br></br>
               6. Paying it forward
               Cultivating a culture of reciprocation to inspire positive transformation within our community and
               society. This is demonstrated by helping those around us as needed, based on the support that we
               previously received, especially seeing our learners coming back as tutors or staff members.
               <br></br>
               7. Responsibility for self and others
               Promoting a culture of lifelong learning and personal development whilst taking ownership for one’s
               actions and behaviours. Supporting each other through psychosocial initiatives to foster optimal
               growth and wellbeing of the entire IkamvaYouth community.
